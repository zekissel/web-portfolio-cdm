<h2>Website Portfolio for ENGCMP0610 (Composing Digital Media)</h2>
<h4>By: Zane Kissel</h4>
<hr>

<p>The goal for my project is to create a website that displays the skills I've developed in Composing Digital Media. I also want to show some other technical skills I've developed at Pitt, so this project is ideal for a job-seeking portfolio that I would link on my resume.</p>
